LA Underground Inc. - Great Game!!! How bout a Black Ops 2 Remastered for the PS4? (4.0 out of 5 stars)
This game is dope! I personally didn't play this cod game till now even tho I bought the PS3 version 1 or 2 years ago..weird huh? Anyway this game is plain and simple one of the best COD games ever...Since I've gotten it, I've been playing it everyday...I skipped Infinite Warfare and took a long time to warm up to BOPS3...even tho I love that one too...This game brought back the good ol feelings of Black Ops 1...Graphics and sound are on point...I highly recommend this game..ppl are rating this game super low...don't understand the hate...when has a COD game ever included a dlc? Never! Anyway clean game, highly enjoyable maps...I would state this is a must have for the PS4 alongside Advanced and BOPS3...WW2 looks to be the return of full fledged COD glory...until then enjoy MW Remastered u won't be disappointed! Love this game...

J - Need a king of FPS developers (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Too bad you can’t give a lower rating.

This game was once the best game ever made. It’s what got me playing Online, my dad and I used to play. Now it’s not even worth buying a second time except the only benefit Is there are no Modders in this one, or atleast not as many. Game is still good and true to the original except for the fact of the Supply Drop, and the $40 price tag, and the lack of DLC to be added in with the price.

Overpriced and doesn't include 10 year old DLC. This is an embarrassment to Activision.

Nomad Driver - For $15, definitely overpaid. But still a fun shooter if this is your first time through COD (3.0 out of 5 stars)
Sticking with the solo campaign, it was somewhat fun to relive some of the classic missions and playing through the upgraded game engine. But as a Remastered version, it's still the same journey as it's advertised to be, and if you've played the original to death (like I have) on the consoles or PC, you're really not missing much if you give this a pass

MARNY - RIPOFF (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Please do not buy this until it goes way down in price. This remaster doesn't even include all the maps from the original release! Insulting that the standalone version did not include the DLC. I don't support this business practice of taking content out of a game so greedy Activision can sell it back to you separately as DLC.

M3NTU721 - What a bunch of cry babies. You all knew ... (5.0 out of 5 stars)
What a bunch of cry babies. You all knew it had to come out by itself sooner or later. Why are you complaining, nobody forced you to buy infinite warfare.

incrypto - They always put out the best COD/multiplayer IMO and also keep working on their releases ... (1.0 out of 5 stars)
I won't be buying this because of the obvious greed of Activision with the high price, no DLC included, and microtransactions.  I wish Treyarch was their own company and not affiliated with Activision. They always put out the best COD/multiplayer IMO and also keep working on their releases for years after they've been out. Thanks, Treyarch. Black Ops 1 was a true classic.

Joseph Wierzbinski - I don't play online or do co-ops or anything like that. I just like to play my game ... (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Okay so I'm a bit new to modern video games. Guess I'm just a late bloomer. I don't play online or do co-ops or anything like that. I just like to play my game and have a good time and overcome a challenge. So this being my first time playing a Call of Duty game period. I've had a ton of fun playing this game as I'm not overly concerned about the DLC. I've found this an enjoyable game. My only hope is they decide to remaster the other modern warfare games so I can play those too.

--------------------------------------
luca cariauli - the best call of duty ever (5.0 out of 5 stars)
well what should i say that it's the best call of duty in the modern warfare franchise!! i don't care about the add-ons, the game is flawless i will receive platinum for this game mark my words!

Nucks - Dirty pool Activision! (1.0 out of 5 stars)
The avarice of Activision appears to be boundless. The business model Activision is setting a precedent on here is blatantly anti-consumer. Forcing consumers to purchase extra DLC to get a complete version of a remastered version of a decade old game is just downright low. And publishers wonder why consumers are filled with indignation towards them.

--------------------------------------
Fammysick - Speak with your wallets (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Don't feed Activision's greed, they knew they screwed up with that Legacy Edition crap on Infinite Warfare, now they're trying to recoup those lost sales. Not to mention $40 is way too steep, trying to cash in on the likes of Crash Bandicoot's model. Thing is, that game is complete with free DLC and RELEASED at $40.

--------------------------------------
Paul Cullen - Still great after all these years (4.0 out of 5 stars)
Just as much fun when I last played the original game about 8-9 years ago.  If you were a fan of this game, it's worth picking up.  Would have been 5 stars if it was $30 vs $40, but it's still worth it at $40.

Dyers_Eve - I "don't get" the low reviews, its awesome. (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Got this game on a rental and I already owned the original PC version. After not returning it for nearly a month I purchased the game for 40 bucks thru prime and it was worth it.  It looks great, it plays great, the campaign is really fun especially the chapter "Death From Above" where you get an AC-130 gunship to provide close air support for the SAS troops. Like any good game its the frustration that keeps you playing over and over and over again. After owning Black Ops 3 I find the multiplayer far superior and a lot more fun than black ops 3. The maps are superior, funner and you're not limited to just "specialists". I don't understand the low reviews at all. I like the play control with the ps4 controller to a mouse and keyboard. The only negatives would be limited on scorestreaks to radar, helicopter and air strike.

I admit I'm more of an RTS player than a FPS player and certain elements of both the campaign and multiplayer are extremely frustrating and I find myself swearing at the game repeatedly lol  but would it be as fun? if you weren't? The "velcro" grenades that even if you move away from them still kill you, even if you're out of line of sight in a building the AI can still manage to throw a grenade exactly where you are killing you. In a multiplayer map versus bots silencers and the not appearing on radar perk do absolutely no good they still know precisely where you are even thru cover and not visible. They are notorious after a kill coming up behind you, shooting you point blank in the back and you never even saw them or a red dot for them on the mini map.  Also even thick cover seems to do no good. On one map there are K-rails (concrete freeway dividers filled with metal rebar) I was shot THRU the K-rail even without the "deep impact" perk as you can imagine I was livid over that death lol. I don't know if its a staple of COD games but in both the campaign and multiplayer you're getting shot repeatedly and despite looking around everywhere even with the red arrow that appears you've got no dam clue where its coming from before you're dead, Try going thru the "charlie don't surf" chapter on your way to the tv station and getting bullet ridden, grenaded, and RPG'd despite killing everything you can visually see, once inside the large broadcast room bullets everywhere and multiple deaths before you make it to the area where the enemies finally stop endlessly respawning.

The multiplayer variety map pack was worth the money for the maps it has.  My personal favorites? Chinatown, Beach Bog, Crossfire and Broadcast.  Unlike the original PC version of MW4 the ability to play multiplayer, free for all, deathmatch, etc with bots is super fun. They did a fantastic job of making bot AI as realistic as they could to actual players, even though rules that apply to players don't apply to bots lol. I think the multiplayer on this game is also better than Infinite warfare as well. It would be great if they would continue making maps for this game on MP.  Cannot wait to play WW2 in November.  This game could use a weapon DLC for replayability value. A separate subscription for ps plus JUST to be able to play "online" does kinda suck that's the kind of thing that should just be included with your purchase. Either buy this NEW or buy the legacy edition NEW ONLY and its worth the bang for the buck. I've heard sometimes you can get this game on sale for a cheaper price.

--------------------------------------
The Dukes Brew - DO NOT BUY!!!! RIP OFF!!!! (1.0 out of 5 stars)
I wouldn't pay more then 15 bucks for this thing maybe 20 if it had the dlc but 40 bucks! That is ridiculous I suggest and highly recommend to everyone not to buy this at least until the price drops

--------------------------------------
Emmanuel - Don't waste your money (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Either wait for a sale or don't buy at all. The 40 dollar price tag is ludicrous enough but it doesn't even include the dlc. An atrocious handling of an otherwise solid remaster of a great game.

--------------------------------------
M. Moser - Great to play this classic game on next gen console (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Bring back great memories of when this game was huge on ps3/360 and plays almost identical. You can still find some online lobbies in TDM and a handful of other game types.

Maan Zaini - GREAT!! (5.0 out of 5 stars)
The game is great & everything, finally a standalone also too, by the way. The ratings by the way it's because of the fact there is supply drops & the price of this standalone, also the map packs! So, other than that, it's all set! Don't worry. Not that it's a bad game, it's just a way of boycotting and protesting.

Note: Really ironic too by the way that the XBOX® One version (which came out a month later) has more than this, which I don't know why...! ;P ;/ >:(
Not sure...And ugh

Dallin H. - but none sucked me in like they used too (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Ok so I had to stop what I was doing, because what people are saying about this bothered me...and I am not one to write reviews. I have played every call of duty since I was a kid. And honestly have been a COD hater. Big time. Hardcore player of battlefield after black ops one. But always played the others, but none sucked me in like they used too. I was curious when this was announced, but they bundled it with infinite warfare and after renting that, I forgot all about it. Fast forward to now..saw this decided I would try it out, thought the 40 was a little high though since the dlc pack wasnt included. And hearing how they were adding guns and supply drops..I honestly don't know why I bought this. But I did. I am so sucked into this game now. It has that feeling of old call of duty, mixed with the new. I was skeptical of that first , but after playing you realize that cod4 is very dated and if they were just to remake the original with new graphics, this would get boring quick. Yeah it would have a small loyal fan base, but they additions of weapons and supply drops make it so much better. Plus this has the best supply drop system yet(Looking at you Black ops 3, you get a big middle finger) After only having it for 4 days I have already gotten a new weapon, the people at raven soft have created some of the most amazing weapon kits and skins, I am blown away. Nothing in previous Cods has made want to play to really get them, its kinda been like a "huh thats kinda cool." But man, this are so freaking sweet in this game. Honestly I really hope they continue to add new maps too, even though I got the DLC,  that should have been included, but I got it on sale, so I figured with that I also get the 10 supply drops, which I have never bought before or wanted too. So if you miss old COD, do your self a favor and buy this, with the new stuff it makes it truly amazing while still keeping to the feel of COD4. There are so many people online and they have said they want to support this game for a long time. Anyways back to what I was doing...playing the best Call Of Duty game in years!

Supbro - Game deserves negative stars (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Game is okay. Single player graphics and sound is clear and vivid. BUT SEVERAL DOWNSIDES are that the multiplayer is a camp fest. Dying in literally one burst from a M16A4 is bull. Lag is a issue in this crap game. And be prepared to die constantly from random hail mary grenades  that ppl chuck from cross the map. You cant counter this with flak jacket because there is NO FLAK JACKET.
The same 3 Killstreaks get boring really fast. UAV, Airstrike, and helicopter. The heli is basically pointless cause it gets shot down within 10 secs you called it in.

People don't even play other game modes because from the lack of players on the game! There's basically only TDM, DOMINATION, AND SEARCH AND DESTROY to play. I'm not even going to bother playing that Infinite Warfare bullcrap cause it's even worse with the jumpboots and futuristic bullcrap.

If you're thinking about buying this game, i advise you, DO NOT. Save the 30 something bucks and buy a whole better game than this garbage. I regret buying this junk all because I wanted to take a trip Down memory lane.

Jack McMuffin - Don't buy this game because of nostalgia. (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Don't buy this game because of nostalgia. It's not the same game at all. They shouldn't even call it a remaster, they should call it a remake. The only real upside to the game honestly is the menus and UI is more sleek.

The very first thing the game presents to you when you boot it up, is it gives you a "supply drop" (loot box) and steers you to the "depot" to open your lootbox. The only reason this game was even released was because nobody was interested in Infinite Warfare. I opted to wait because I didn't want IW and knew this would eventually release by itself. I was excited to play it, as I loved the original, but trade it in to Gamestop the very next day.

It simply wasn't fun, everything is all about the damn supply drops. Progression felt very slow. Also, they charge for maps that you already paid for in 2007 as additional DLC. How greedy can Activision get??

Team Deathmatch was really the only mode that was very populated. Search and Destroy had a somewhat decent population but in older CODs TDM is always where the most people will be, unfortunately. I personally prefer objective-oriented modes, rather than just running around trying for kills. (In which case, expect a lot of campers and quickscopers) Even in TDM, It was often 3 or 4 vs 5 or 6. The games weren't always full..

It was extremely disappointing. I'd only recommend getting this if you're planning on going through the campaign again, in which case I wouldn't spend more than $10 on it.

Skipster - IT'S MODERN WARFARE !!!! (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Arguably the best game of the COD series. Now only better, if you fancy online play and story mode. Otherwise take a pass. I hadn't gamed in several years but when I heard about this I was drawn back in like a month to the flame. Graphics, holy smokes, seriously, it looks amazing and if you don't have a sweet quality HDTV or better then you're missing out. However if your interested in alternate game modes and all the various other features, take a pass. They aren't here on the side version. Maybe the dl version has them, I can't say but the disc version has 3 modes, story mode, online multiplayer and offline multiplayer which is straight up you and a friend going haed to head shooting beside 1 another on the same console via split screen. But otherwise, but this game, best price there is for a new copy, used copies are sketchy and get your game on.

s - huge waste of time (1.0 out of 5 stars)
This is the last call of duty/activation game for me.  Boot load loop in ps4. brand new ps4 all my other games work just fine. My mistake i bought for christmas and just got around to this. I should have opened over my vacation. Anyway to be honest this is a massive joke. should never have bought this. what a chores this and the gpu prices is why i left pc gaming.

let's be honest this series has been doing down hill for a while. they keep trying to do all this future space stuff, when "all any of us really want" is a real war experience. totally stupid that they can't get a game form 10 years ago or whatever to work on a modern platform.

at least i only paid like 20, and didn't get roped into that other game.

Yoli - To balance out the 1 Star Review (5.0 out of 5 stars)
35GB is nothing for a 500G console or especially a 1TB console. Especially when you compare them to games like Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Grand Theft Auto V, Destiny, Just Cause 3, Battlefield 4, Until Dawn, and many more games which are well over 50GBs of space. If anything, this game requires the lower end of space that games normally require. Storage issue is no reason to give a game 1/5 unless that game somehow takes up half or more than half of your storage.

Linda Bishop - Looks great, sounds great (1.0 out of 5 stars)
The remaster itself - incredible. Looks great, sounds great, plays wonderfully. It's aged alright; the core gameplay still holds up after all these years. However, keep in mind it is the simple and redundant formula that the series has recycled for a literal generation.

The concept - laughable.
First, Activision coerces us to drop $80 and buy Infinite Warfare just to play this.
Next, they add new weapons behind a supply drop paywall, tarnishing the original game and adding a pay-to-win element.
Then, they release maps that were included for free with the original game but slap a $15 price tag on them this go-around.
As if that all wasn't a big enough joke, now they release it as a standalone with timed exclusivity for $40, and the DLC isn't even included.

At some point I think Activision need to seriously reconsider their practices. Please don't buy this.

Michael M. - Intense battle scenarios. I love it! (5.0 out of 5 stars)
This is one of the best action packed miltary games I've ever played. Some firefights scenarios are very intense in a fun challenging way. Really gets my 65 year old mind totally engaged in the fights! The scenery graphics are believable. The only issue I have is at times when you as a marine are in the midst of a major firefight other marines seem to pop into your view just as your about to squeeze the trigger. Or when your trying to escape a grenade up pops a marine getting In your escape path and kaboom your dead. I still love the game none the less.

Good game, COD is my fav of all time.  was excited when i heard this was coming out and very upset that they bundled it into another one of their crappy games and charged 80bucks.  I would have gladly payed 40-50 for just remastered upon launch.  Instead i had to wait a year.  got it for 30 recently and i love it.  brings back a lot of memories.  game is about 90% original, they added some dumb unnecessary things to it.

I don't really like this game too much, I made a mistake, I thought it would be better but the graphics and some other things don't worth it. It was my fault buying this game because I just line too much call of duty MW3 and I buy this one because I thought it would be similar but no...

Devin - Review of the game, not business ethics (4.0 out of 5 stars)
First, I'll say that I never played CoD 4 when it came out (I started playing CoD with World at War). I bought this mostly as a curiosity to see if Modern Warfare was as good as people claimed. I liked that it was a standalone (I had and still have no interest in buying Infinite Warfare).

As for the game. I like it, but don't love it. Remember that I have zero sense of nostalgia for this game, so I feel my opinion is a bit more objective than those looking through rose-colored, nostalgia-filled glasses. The multiplayer is pretty good, but nothing really new (it is a remaster of a decade-old game, after all). The guns are fine, the maps are good, and there's no stupid jetpacking around. The campaign is pretty mediocre, but nobody buys CoD for the campaigns. If you just loved the original Modern Warfare, I'm sure you'll love this remaster. The graphics are quite impressive.

Overall, it's a pretty good game. I don't regret buying it. I just hope they also remaster World at War and co-release it with CoD: WWII.

Everyone is complaining on the price but my God, this game is amazing. the campaign looks great, and the multiplayer is really enjoyable (aside from campers). Now a lot of people complain about supply drops but they aren't awful, the weapons can be crafted and none of the guns can dominate a game.

shaunfromohio - Best Call of Duty ever made! (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Best Call of Duty game ever im glad they brought it back. I never purchased mine from amazon but its a AWESOME game. Yeah it might not have been right what Activision did but there a business and its no different than purchasing a new call of duty such as WW2. Those new call of duty games are not call of duty to me not even close. Anyway ignore all the hate this game is the best ever 5/5

Probably one of the worst call of duty’s other than infinate warefare. The mechanics are terrible. You can barely walk through a door way without running into the door frame. The game itself is just terrible. Please do not waste your money on this game. Makes me wonder how bad black ops 4 will be

This is an amazing game however  The only real issue would be the price $40 one would expect that the DLC would come along with it as a bundle but it is not and have to pay An additional $15 just to get it

Will Savell - really fun game. (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Lots of fun. Really like the campaign mode. Great maps. Like the wild dogs in the Chernobyl level. They'll give the bad guys heck if you don't scare them when you pass them in the pool.

--------------------------------------
H.C. - Okay (3.0 out of 5 stars)
Great game, probably last good one they’ll make but still dumb how there’s no Halloween Overgrown, seems like they’re done with the game how they put all the weekend playlists left out and holiday maps in the playlist cycles but no Halloween Overgrown?...
Didn’t even include mad props in the weekend event playlist which is dumb and I wanted a knives only too but no

Overall okay, B04 doesn’t seem good either

Lol, temporary out of stock... i see that so many greedy people bought this that Activision clearly ruined a good game, couldn't keep it original to how it was back in the day, without thier BS pay to win supply drop garbage new weapons make it unbalanced, force to pay for same dlc content / mp maps waste of time with thier greedy money whores.

Forrest - Patience is a Virtue. (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Classic Call of Duty at it's finest. I personally didn't make the mistake to buy Infinite Warfare, and waited for the physical release because I like having games on my shelf. Call it overpriced, but the fact that I can get both Infinite Warfare and this game on my shelf with 2 physical copies and no ties between the 2 at the same price as the Legacy Edition was when it first came out, sounds like a win to me. Patience is a virtue, my friends.

C. Ramos - Absolutely Awful (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Don't support greedy devs. This game has loot boxes in multiplayer now, which means it's pay to win basically. Plus the map pack is $15 and it was included free in the original GOTY Edition!

--------------------------------------
Patrick Bowen - Good game (5.0 out of 5 stars)

Very good game! I thought I wouldn’t be able to get into games, but no, there are still a lot of people playing.

Definetely 5/7 game. Awesome. Will play again.

Jonathan Roman - Also don't be suckered into the next remastered game until they do the stand alone like they said they wouldn't do (1.0 out of 5 stars)
40 dollars? LOL. Please don't buy this game until it hits 19.99 with DLC included. The game will still be there don't worry. You won't miss out on anything. Also don't be suckered into the next remastered game until they do the stand alone like they said they wouldn't do. Terrible ethics.

The game is classic, but Activision is notorious for their greed. I waited months for this game to come out on its own to dodge their greed. I will wait again for the price drop and hopefully a DLC inclusion. Not buying this game for over $25.00

--------------------------------------
Amazon Customer - Just like old times (4.0 out of 5 stars)
I played this game when it first came out in 2007. This was like jumping in a time machine. This is a perfect remake with needed modernization in the form of loot boxes/ weapons, which add a fun post game gift like overwatch. Game lobbies are smooth and matchmaking is easy. The price is outrageous for a 10 year old game, But if youre looking for a nostalgia shot this is a good way to go. This is a review of the game itself and not of Activision (money hungry dogs).

Anyonomus - Activion is stupid and honestly only cares about money (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Why would you buy this when the legendary edition is the same price?  Activion is stupid and honestly only cares about money.  The game is great and break backs memories of my college days, but purchase the legendary edition as it is the same price.

Betty Phillips - Five Stars (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Great game

Amazon Customer - What a sham (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Can't believe Activision has the cahones to charge $40 for this 8 months after it was used as bait for the overpriced flop that was infinite warfare. It's company's like Activision to that deserve to fail and be replaced by consumer friendly competition. Do not buy this until you feel you are getting the value you feel your dollars deserve.

--------------------------------------
Amazon Customer - Great game with a nice throwback to the good times (4.0 out of 5 stars)
Great game with a nice throwback to the good times, but the head-glitching with M16s is the only thing off about this game

Review is cor Activision. You know you can get the legacy version for about the same price which includes this game. No dlc either. This game is $20 at the most.  I now have reservations about getting WW 2. I thought price gouging was illegal.

--------------------------------------
Amazon Customer - Amazing game RUINED by developers. (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Amazing game ruined by money hungry developers. If you were looking for the game you played as a kid this isn’t it. So many features have been added I.e supply drops, supply drop weapons, weapons that don’t belong in the game. As well as melee weapons. Save yourself the money and wait till reviews drop this game down to $5.

--------------------------------------
Amazon Customer - One Star (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Not worth $40. Wait everyone, they always put out sales!

JAB - Well worth the wait (5.0 out of 5 stars)
Masterfully redone. A classic that has been revamped with up to date graphics. Been waiting for this remaster for a long time.

Kevin Pereira - Paying new game $$ for a  "Remaster" (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Wait for the price drop and inclusion of DLC...this is a remaster but they are trying to make you pay for it like its some new game. Bide your time, and save your $$$$

--------------------------------------
Andrew - DOES NOT WORK (1.0 out of 5 stars)
One review said the game would not load. This game made it to the same spot during loading four times and this is after a reboot on the system twice. I went to PlayStation store for assistance and found none. The digital download was a better price at the PlayStation site. Keep this up guys and you'll be out of business.

This is a massive money grab, even if you can easily afford it don't do it. Activision will always remain an evil corporation.

SJ - Do. Not. Buy. This. (1.0 out of 5 stars)
Activision, I know you're in it to make money, but this is pure greed that is rarely seen by any company to this degree. It's been 8 months since this game released with Infinite Warfare and you can't even be bothered to include the one and only DLC this game had. I can't imagine any other publisher in the industry charging $15 for a 10 year old DLC on a remastered game, including EA. Not to mention that you lied to your long time fans of the series by saying that the remaster would “stay true to the original” and then you went ahead and added supply drops containing weapons that were most certainly not in the original game.

Activision, what happened to you? You once were a good game publisher, but now, you're a bunch of con artists. It probably won't do much, but here, have a one star review. It's only right I return the favor after buying COD games for the past 10 years, including Infinite Warfare, which I didn't even want. I only wanted a simple remaster of my favorite multiplayer game ever. Shame on me for falling for your tricks. It'll be the last time I do.

I don't care about the price of the game, this was one of the best call of duty games ever made and I can't wait for call of duty ww2 because it's taking it back to the original roots of call of duty

Rico Suave - Whats with all the 1 star reviews?? (4.0 out of 5 stars)
Jeez a lot of hurt people in the reviews Lol it's just a game nobody forced you to buy it, anyway the game itself is a nice remaster of the greatest call of duty campaign ever forget the multiplayer I was never good at it the campaign outshines the multiplayer in many ways
