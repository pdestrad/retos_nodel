After not returning it for nearly a month I purchased the game for 40 bucks thru prime and it was worth it.  It looks great, it plays great, the campaign is really fun especially the chapter ""Death From Above"" where you get an AC-130 gunship to provide close air support for the SAS troops. Like any good game its the frustration that keeps you playing over and over and over again. After owning Black Ops 3 I find the multiplayer far superior and a lot more fun than black ops 3. The maps are superior, funner and you're not limited to just ""specialists"". I don't understand the low reviews at all. I like the play control with the ps4 controller to a mouse and keyboard. The only negatives would be limited on scorestreaks to radar, helicopter and air strike.

I admit I'm more of an RTS player than a FPS player and certain elements of both the campaign and multiplayer are extremely frustrating and I find myself swearing at the game repeatedly lol  but would it be as fun? if you weren't? The ""velcro"" grenades that even if you move away from them still kill you, even if you're out of line of sight in a building the AI can still manage to throw a grenade exactly where you are killing you. In a multiplayer map versus bots silencers and the not appearing on radar perk do absolutely no good they still know precisely where you are even thru cover and not visible. They are notorious after a kill coming up behind you, shooting you point blank in the back and you never even saw them or a red dot for them on the mini map.  Also even thick cover seems to do no good. On one map there are K-rails (concrete freeway dividers filled with metal rebar) I was shot THRU the K-rail even without the ""deep impact"" perk as you can imagine I was livid over that death lol. I don't know if its a staple of COD games but in both the campaign and multiplayer you're getting shot repeatedly and despite looking around everywhere even with the red arrow that appears you've got no dam clue where its coming from before you're dead, Try going thru the ""charlie don't surf"" chapter on your way to the tv station and getting bullet ridden, grenaded, and RPG'd despite killing everything you can visually see, once inside the large broadcast room bullets everywhere and multiple deaths before you make it to the area where the enemies finally stop endlessly respawning.

The multiplayer variety map pack was worth the money for the maps it has.  My personal favorites? Chinatown, Beach Bog, Crossfire and Broadcast.  Unlike the original PC version of MW4 the ability to play multiplayer, free for all, deathmatch, etc with bots is super fun. They did a fantastic job of making bot AI as realistic as they could to actual players, even though rules that apply to players don't apply to bots lol. I think the multiplayer on this game is also better than Infinite warfare as well. It would be great if they would continue making maps for this game on MP.  Cannot wait to play WW2 in November.  This game could use a weapon DLC for replayability value. A separate subscription for ps plus JUST to be able to play ""online"" does kinda suck that's the kind of thing that should just be included with your purchase. Either buy this NEW or buy the legacy edition NEW ONLY and its worth the bang for the buck. I've heard sometimes you can get this game on sale for a cheaper price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Remastered-PlayStation/product-reviews/B072FP29S9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have played every call of duty since I was a kid. And honestly have been a COD hater. Big time. Hardcore player of battlefield after black ops one. But always played the others, but none sucked me in like they used too. I was curious when this was announced, but they bundled it with infinite warfare and after renting that, I forgot all about it. Fast forward to now..saw this decided I would try it out, thought the 40 was a little high though since the dlc pack wasnt included. And hearing how they were adding guns and supply drops..I honestly don't know why I bought this. But I did. I am so sucked into this game now. It has that feeling of old call of duty, mixed with the new. I was skeptical of that first , but after playing you realize that cod4 is very dated and if they were just to remake the original with new graphics, this would get boring quick. Yeah it would have a small loyal fan base, but they additions of weapons and supply drops make it so much better. Plus this has the best supply drop system yet(Looking at you Black ops 3, you get a big middle finger) After only having it for 4 days I have already gotten a new weapon, the people at raven soft have created some of the most amazing weapon kits and skins, I am blown away. Nothing in previous Cods has made want to play to really get them, its kinda been like a ""huh thats kinda cool."" But man, this are so freaking sweet in this game. Honestly I really hope they continue to add new maps too, even though I got the DLC,  that should have been included, but I got it on sale, so I figured with that I also get the 10 supply drops, which I have never bought before or wanted too. So if you miss old COD, do your self a favor and buy this, with the new stuff it makes it truly amazing while still keeping to the feel of COD4. There are so many people online and they have said they want to support this game for a long time. Anyways back to what I was doing...playing the best Call Of Duty game in years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Remastered-PlayStation/product-reviews/B072FP29S9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Single player graphics and sound is clear and vivid. BUT SEVERAL DOWNSIDES are that the multiplayer is a camp fest. Dying in literally one burst from a M16A4 is bull. Lag is a issue in this crap game. And be prepared to die constantly from random hail mary grenades  that ppl chuck from cross the map. You cant counter this with flak jacket because there is NO FLAK JACKET.
The same 3 Killstreaks get boring really fast. UAV, Airstrike, and helicopter. The heli is basically pointless cause it gets shot down within 10 secs you called it in.

People don't even play other game modes because from the lack of players on the game! There's basically only TDM, DOMINATION, AND SEARCH AND DESTROY to play. I'm not even going to bother playing that Infinite Warfare bullcrap cause it's even worse with the jumpboots and futuristic bullcrap.

If you're thinking about buying this game, i advise you, DO NOT. Save the 30 something bucks and buy a whole better game than this garbage.

It's not the same game at all. They shouldn't even call it a remaster, they should call it a remake. The only real upside to the game honestly is the menus and UI is more sleek.

The very first thing the game presents to you when you boot it up, is it gives you a ""supply drop"" (loot box) and steers you to the ""depot"" to open your lootbox. The only reason this game was even released was because nobody was interested in Infinite Warfare. I opted to wait because I didn't want IW and knew this would eventually release by itself. I was excited to play it, as I loved the original, but trade it in to Gamestop the very next day.

It simply wasn't fun, everything is all about the damn supply drops. Progression felt very slow. Also, they charge for maps that you already paid for in 2007 as additional DLC. How greedy can Activision get??

Team Deathmatch was really the only mode that was very populated. Search and Destroy had a somewhat decent population but in older CODs TDM is always where the most people will be, unfortunately. I personally prefer objective-oriented modes, rather than just running around trying for kills. (In which case, expect a lot of campers and quickscopers) Even in TDM, It was often 3 or 4 vs 5 or 6. The games weren't always full..

It was extremely disappointing. I'd only recommend getting this if you're planning on going through the campaign again, in which case I wouldn't spend more than $10 on it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Looks great, sounds great, plays wonderfully. It's aged alright; the core gameplay still holds up after all these years. However, keep in mind it is the simple and redundant formula that the series has recycled for a literal generation.

The concept - laughable.
First, Activision coerces us to drop $80 and buy Infinite Warfare just to play this.
Next, they add new weapons behind a supply drop paywall, tarnishing the original game and adding a pay-to-win element.
Then, they release maps that were included for free with the original game but slap a $15 price tag on them this go-around.
As if that all wasn't a big enough joke, now they release it as a standalone with timed exclusivity for $40, and the DLC isn't even included.

At some point I think Activision need to seriously reconsider their practices. Please don't buy this.","1.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I bought this mostly as a curiosity to see if Modern Warfare was as good as people claimed. I liked that it was a standalone (I had and still have no interest in buying Infinite Warfare).

As for the game. I like it, but don't love it. Remember that I have zero sense of nostalgia for this game, so I feel my opinion is a bit more objective than those looking through rose-colored, nostalgia-filled glasses. The multiplayer is pretty good, but nothing really new (it is a remaster of a decade-old game, after all). The guns are fine, the maps are good, and there's no stupid jetpacking around. The campaign is pretty mediocre, but nobody buys CoD for the campaigns. If you just loved the original Modern Warfare, I'm sure you'll love this remaster. The graphics are quite impressive.

Overall, it's a pretty good game. I don't regret buying it. I just hope they also remaster World at War and co-release it with CoD: WWII.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Call-Duty-Modern-Warfare-Remastered-PlayStation/product-reviews/B072FP29S9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It's been 8 months since this game released with Infinite Warfare and you can't even be bothered to include the one and only DLC this game had. I can't imagine any other publisher in the industry charging $15 for a 10 year old DLC on a remastered game, including EA. Not to mention that you lied to your long time fans of the series by saying that the remaster would “stay true to the original” and then you went ahead and added supply drops containing weapons that were most certainly not in the original game.

Activision, what happened to you? You once were a good game publisher, but now, you're a bunch of con artists. It probably won't do much, but here, have a one star review. It's only right I return the favor after buying COD games for the past 10 years, including Infinite Warfare, which I didn't even want.
